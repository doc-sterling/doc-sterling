- 👋 Hi, I’m @doc-sterling, or Sullivan, and I use GitHub as a pastebin to share citations, books, and other information I don't want to bother looking for on my desktop when I need it in a short span of time.
- 👀 I’m interested in ... Researching how the human body works on a molecular level
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... How to be a better teacher and writer
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... Whatever, as long as it's within my fields
- 📫 How to reach me ... My personal email is sanctifiedcatalase @ protonmail .com (remove the spaces)
